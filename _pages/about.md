I am an experienced vision scientist with a strong foundation in cognitive research, experimental design, statistical analysis, eye tracking, and programming. I used to study such aspects of human visual perception as illusions, attention, unconscious processing and perceptual grouping.
Now I am interested in applying my reasearch experince to different fileds of everyday life.
